# TMS Architecture — Entity Model and Traceability

Definitive reference for the four TMS entities, their fields, their links, and the order in which to create them. Read this when creating any artifact, validating traceability, or fixing broken links.

> **Before publishing any TMS entity body (Test / TestPlan / TestExecution / TestRun) to Jira rich-text fields**, read `../../agentic-qa-core/references/jira-publishing-gotchas.md` — covers the two ADF conversion gotchas (`md-to-adf` mark collision + MCP batched custom-field rejection) that silently fail HTTP 400.

---

## 1. The four entities

Every QA-tested user story produces four artifact types. The model is tool-agnostic: the same structure applies in Jira+Xray, native Jira, Coda, Azure DevOps, and TestRail. Only the implementing issue types differ.

| Entity | Full name | Purpose | When created | Where the content lives |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **US** | User Story / Backlog item | The requirement under test | Pre-QA | Description + ACs |
| **ATP** | Acceptance Test Plan | Approach, risk analysis, AC-to-TC coverage. Contains the Test Analysis. | Stage 1 (Planning) | ATP issue body |
| **ATR** | Acceptance Test Results | Execution results, findings, evidence. Contains the Test Report. | Stage 1 (created early), filled Stage 3 | ATR issue body |
| **TC** | Test Case | Individual test: precondition + action + expected. Lives in a test repository. | Stage 4 (Documentation) | TC issue body |

### Container per modality (load-bearing)

The entity model is tool-agnostic, but the **container** each entity lives in changes with the TMS modality. Resolve modality via `test-documentation/SKILL.md` §Phase 0 before using these mappings.

| Entity | Modality jira-xray | Modality jira-native (no Xray) |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **US** | Jira `Story` | Jira `Story` |
| **ATP** | Xray `Test Plan` issue. Named `Test Plan: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}`. Linked to the Story via "tests". | Story's `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` field (source of truth); falls back to a `## Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)` comment only when the field is absent. **No separate issue created.** |
| **ATR** | Xray `Test Execution` issue. Named `Test Results: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}`. Holds `Test Runs` per TC, plus Environment, Begin/End Date. Gets populated by CI import. | Story's `{{jira.acceptance_test_results}}` field (source of truth); falls back to a `## Acceptance Test Results (ATR)` comment only when the field is absent. **No separate issue.** CI updates Test Status field on each TC directly. |
| **TC** | Xray `Test` issue (type Manual / Cucumber / Generic) | Jira-native `Test` custom issue type (set up per `references/jira-setup.md`) or `Task` with a `Test Type` custom field. |
| **Test Set / Precondition / Test Plan hierarchy** | First-class Xray issue types | Not available — group by labels + Regression Epic. |

Key consequences:

- In **Modality jira-native**, there is no separate "Test Plan issue" to link to — all ATP/ATR content lives on the Story itself. Traceability from a TC back to the plan/results walks via the "is tested by" link to the Story, then reads the Story's custom fields.
- In **Modality jira-xray**, the `Test Plan` and `Test Execution` issues are real, queryable, filterable by JQL, and (critically) the Test Execution is the target of `[TMS_TOOL] Import Results` at the end of every CI run.
- The naming convention (`Test Plan: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}` / `Test Results: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}`) stays the same in both modalities — in B it identifies the section header in the Story comment, not an issue key.

```
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                            |
|   User Story ({{PROJECT_KEY}}-123)                         |
|     |                                                      |
|     +--- Test Plan link ---> ATP (Test Plan: ...-123)      |
|     |                          |                           |
|     +--- Test Results link ---> ATR (Test Results: ...-123)|
|     |                          |                           |
|     +--- Test Cases links --+                              |
|                             |                              |
|                             v                              |
|                        [ TC-1, TC-2, TC-3, ... TC-N ]      |
|                           |   |    |                       |
|                           |   |    +--- links to US, ATP, ATR, AC |
|                           |   +----- links to US, ATP, ATR, AC    |
|                           +-------- links to US, ATP, ATR, AC     |
|                                                                   |
|   All arrows are bidirectional: US <-> ATP <-> ATR <-> TC         |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Cardinality

| From | To | Cardinality | Link direction |
|------|----|-------------|----------------|
| US | ATP | 1:1 | Bidirectional |
| US | ATR | 1:1 | Bidirectional |
| US | TC | 1:N | Bidirectional |
| ATP | ATR | 1:1 | Bidirectional |
| ATP | TC | 1:N | TC references ATP |
| ATR | TC | 1:N | TC references ATR |
| TC | AC | N:1 (or N:M) | TC covers one or more ACs |

Given any one of the four, you must be able to navigate to the other three. That is what "traceability" means.

---

## 4. Traceability rules

### Mandatory links

| Entity | Required link | Value | When to set |
|--------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| **ATP** | User Story | US ID or title | At creation |
| **ATP** | Test Results (ATR) | ATR ID or name | After ATR is created |
| **ATR** | User Story | US ID or title | At creation |
| **TC** | User Story | US ID or title | At creation |
| **TC** | Test Plan (ATP) | ATP ID or name | At creation (if ATP exists) |
| **TC** | Test Result (ATR) | ATR ID or name | At creation (if ATR exists) |
| **TC** | Acceptance Criterion | AC reference | At creation |

A TC that is missing even one of Story / ATP / ATR is broken — use `fix-traceability` to repair.

### Validation checklist (before marking Complete)

- [ ] ATP links to User Story AND ATR
- [ ] ATR links to User Story
- [ ] Every TC links to User Story, ATP, and ATR
- [ ] ATP Test Coverage maps all ACs to TCs
- [ ] ATR Test Coverage reflects execution results
- [ ] User Story panel shows references to ATP, ATR, and all TCs

---

## 5. Creation and linking order

Artifacts must be created in a specific sequence. Creating TCs first, ATP second leaves orphaned references that are painful to repair.

### The sequence

```
Step 1. Create ATP
        -> link ATP to User Story
        (ATR link left empty for now)

Step 2. Create ATR
        -> link ATR to User Story

Step 3. Update ATP
        -> link ATP to ATR (bidirectional plan/results)

Step 4. For each TC (as Stage 4 progresses):
        Create TC
        -> link TC to User Story
        -> link TC to ATP
        -> link TC to ATR
        -> link TC to AC
```

### Why this order

1. **ATP first**: the plan must exist before execution results can reference it. Even if the Test Analysis content is filled later, the artifact is created early so that TCs can link to it.
2. **ATR second**: created early so the ATP can reference it. Test Report content is filled after execution.
3. **ATP <-> ATR third**: once both exist, wire up the bidirectional link.
4. **TCs last**: by the time a TC is created, both ATP and ATR exist, so all three links are set at creation.

### Pseudocode — full sequence

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/xray-cli` skill (Modality jira-xray) — in Modality jira-native these `[TMS_TOOL]` calls fall through to `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`, so load `/acli` instead. See §9 for the per-modality split.

```
[TMS_TOOL] Create ATP:
  name: Test Plan: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}
  story: {from User Story title}

[TMS_TOOL] Create ATR:
  name: Test Results: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}
  story: {from User Story title}

[TMS_TOOL] Update ATP:
  id: {from ATP created above}
  results: {from ATR name created above}

[TMS_TOOL] Create TC:
  name: {per TC naming convention}
  story: {from User Story title}
  test-plan: {from ATP name}
  test-result: {from ATR name}
  ac: {from the Acceptance Criterion this TC covers}
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
```

---

## 6. Naming conventions (canonical)

| Entity | Pattern | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| User Story | `{{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}` | `PROJ-123` |
| ATP | `Test Plan: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}` | `Test Plan: PROJ-123` |
| ATR | `Test Results: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}` | `Test Results: PROJ-123` |
| TC (TMS title) | `{US_ID or TS_ID}: TC#: Validate <CORE> <CONDITIONAL>` | `PROJ-150: TC1: Validate successful login with valid credentials` |
| TC (code / ATC) | `Should <behavior> when <condition>` | `Should display error when password is incorrect` |

Rules:

1. ATP and ATR names always include the User Story ID. This makes them searchable, unique per story, and impossible to confuse across stories.
2. TC names follow the pattern `{US_ID or TS_ID}: TC#: Validate <CORE> <CONDITIONAL>`, where `CORE` is verb + object describing the behavior (e.g., `successful login`, `authentication error`) and `CONDITIONAL` is the distinguishing condition (e.g., `with valid credentials`, `when password is incorrect`). The prefix is the Test Set ID (Xray with Test Sets) or the User Story ID (native Jira or Xray without Test Sets).
3. Code-side IDs match the TMS-generated key exactly. The `@atc('PROJ-456')` decorator uses the TMS issue key, not an invented module prefix.
4. Module prefixes (e.g., `AUTH-`, `ORD-`) are used only for local folder/file organization under `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/test-cases/` — they are not the canonical ID.

---

## 7. Completed User Story view

When all In-Sprint Testing stages are complete, the User Story panel in the TMS should look like this:

```
User Story: PROJ-123 — <Story Title>

| Test Plan     | Test Plan: PROJ-123           | Complete |
| Test Results  | Test Results: PROJ-123        | Complete |
| Test Cases    | TC-1, TC-2, TC-3, TC-4        | All with status |

ATP (Test Plan: PROJ-123)
  User Story:    PROJ-123
  Test Analysis: [filled]
  Test Coverage: AC1 -> TC-1; AC2 -> TC-2; AC3 -> TC-3, TC-4
  Test Results:  Test Results: PROJ-123
  Complete:      Yes

ATR (Test Results: PROJ-123)
  User Story:    PROJ-123
  Test Report:   [filled]
  Test Coverage: AC1 -> TC-1 PASSED; AC2 -> TC-2 PASSED; AC3 -> TC-3 PASSED, TC-4 FAILED
  Complete:      Yes

Test Cases
  TC-1 | PASSED | AC1 | Should <behavior> when <condition>
  TC-2 | PASSED | AC2 | Should <behavior> when <condition>
  TC-3 | PASSED | AC3 | Should <behavior> when <condition>
  TC-4 | FAILED | AC3 | Should <behavior> when <condition>
```

### Completeness criteria

A User Story is fully documented when:

1. ATP exists, is linked, and is marked Complete.
2. ATR exists, is linked, and is marked Complete.
3. Every TC has a Test Status (`PASSED`, `FAILED`, or `NOT RUN`).
4. Every AC has either at least one **documented** TC OR an explicit Deferred note in the prioritization report. The documented TC set is intentionally sparse — only the regression-worthy scenarios (Candidate + Manual) are persisted; the wide 1:N derivation happened upstream (in `/sprint-testing` planning + exploration) and most of it is correctly Deferred (no TMS TC). Do NOT inflate documentation to "N TCs per AC" — that is a design/execution concern, not a documentation one.
5. Where a regression-worthy scenario IS persisted, its TC is technique-shaped: a documented boundary TC uses BVA values, a documented state TC covers the transition, etc. (`agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md`). Technique governs the SHAPE of what you document, not how MUCH you document.
6. ATP and ATR are bidirectionally linked.
7. Every TC links to US, ATP, and ATR.

Any failing criterion -> the story is not ready to close QA.

---

## 8. TC workflow state machine

> **Substrate reference**: state and transition names below match the canonical UPEX Jira workflow in `.agents/jira-workflows.json` (see `.agents/jira-required.yaml` `work_types.test_case`). Skills resolve them via `{{jira.status.test_case.<slug>}}` / `{{jira.transition.test_case.<slug>}}`. Rename detection runs via `bun run jira:sync-workflows`.

The TC workflow spans three IQL stages. Key transitions: `start_design` (Draft -> In Design), `ready_to_run` (In Design -> Ready), `for_manual` (Ready -> Manual), `automation_review_from_ready` (Ready -> In Review), `approve_to_automate` (In Review -> Candidate), `start_automation` (Candidate -> In Automation), `create_pr` (In Automation -> Pull Request), `merged` (Pull Request -> Automated). Never skip states; use `back_from_ready` / `back_from_in_design` for rework, `deprecated` (any -> Deprecated) to retire a TC.

```
Stage 2 (Execution)     Stage 4 (Documentation)     Stage 5 (Automation)
-----------------       -----------------------     ---------------------

Draft -> In Design -> Ready -+-- for manual --> Manual         (terminal manual)
                             |
                             +-- automation review --> In Review
                                                         |
                                                         +-- approve to automate --> Candidate
                                                                                         |
                                                                                         +-- start automation --> In Automation
                                                                                                                     |
                                                                                                                     +-- create PR --> Pull Request
                                                                                                                                          |
                                                                                                                                          +-- merged --> Automated

Any state -> Deprecated (when feature is removed)
```

Rules:
- No state can be skipped. Draft must go through In Design before Ready; Ready cannot go straight to Automated.
- Backward transitions are limited: only "back to In Design" (rework) and "any state to Deprecated".
- Manual is not a dead end: a Manual TC can later re-enter In Review if ROI changes.

## 9. Pseudocode — common entity operations

All operations use `[TMS_TOOL]` for TMS-specific actions and `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` for generic issue operations. Resolution via CLAUDE.md Tool Resolution (Xray CLI, Jira CLI, or MCP fallback).

### List and read

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/xray-cli` skill (Modality jira-xray). In Modality jira-native, load `/acli` — these calls map to JQL/search via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`.

```
[TMS_TOOL] List ATPs:
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
  ticket: {from User Story ID}

[TMS_TOOL] List ATRs:
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
  ticket: {from User Story ID}

[TMS_TOOL] List TCs:
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
  ticket: {from User Story ID}

[TMS_TOOL] Get TC:
  id: {from TC ID}
```

### Create

Pseudocode splits by TMS modality — pick the block matching the resolution from SKILL.md §Phase 0. Full per-modality reference in SKILL.md §Quick reference.

#### Parallel TC creation (default for N > 10)

When the candidate list has more than 10 TCs, creating them serially burns the orchestrator's context with raw API responses. Shard the list into chunks of ~5-10 TCs per subagent, cap total subagents at 10. The orchestrator pre-creates the ATP / ATR (Phase 3 §Linking order steps 1-3) **before** dispatching — only the per-TC writes (step 4) are parallelised. See SKILL.md §Subagent Dispatch Strategy for the per-phase pattern table.

**Sharding rule**: `ceil(N / 10)` subagents, each handling roughly equal-sized chunks. If `N > 100`, chunks must be larger than 10 each (cap is on subagent count, not chunk size). Each dispatch follows the 6-component briefing format in `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`.

##### Modality jira-xray (subagent loads `/xray-cli`)

Briefing (6 components per `agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`):

```
Goal: Create <K> Xray Test issues in Jira project <PROJECT_KEY> for chunk <I>/<TOTAL>, link them to ATP <ATP_KEY> and ATR <ATR_KEY>, and return their issue keys.

Context docs:
  - <PBI_FOLDER>/test-specs/<spec>.md (TC definitions for this chunk)
  - .agents/jira-fields.json (custom field IDs)
  - .claude/skills/test-documentation/references/tms-architecture.md (TC body shape, naming, linking order)
  - .claude/skills/test-documentation/references/jira-test-management.md §7 (Description template)

Skills to load: /xray-cli, /acli

Exact instructions:
  1. For each TC in the chunk:
     a. [TMS_TOOL] Create Test: project=<PROJECT_KEY>, type={Cucumber|Manual}, title="{per TC naming convention}", steps-or-gherkin={from spec}.
     b. Capture the returned issue key as <TEST_KEY>.
     c. [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue: issue=<TEST_KEY>, description={full Description template per jira-test-management.md §7}.
     d. [TMS_TOOL] AddTests: testPlan=<ATP_KEY>, tests=[<TEST_KEY>].
     e. [TMS_TOOL] AddTests: execution=<ATR_KEY>, tests=[<TEST_KEY>].
     f. [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Link Issues: linkType={{jira.link_types.test.name}}, outward=<TEST_KEY>, inward=<STORY_KEY>.   # Story is tested by Test (resolve by slug + verify direction per agentic-qa-core/references/traceability-linking.md §2/§4)
  2. Apply labels per the methodology naming convention (see `tms-conventions.md` §Labels).

Report format:
  JSON array per TC:
  [
    {
      "tc_local_id": "<spec id>",
      "issue_key": "<PROJ>-<N>",
      "linked_to_atp": true,
      "linked_to_atr": true,
      "linked_to_story": true,
      "errors": []
    },
    ...
  ]
  Trailing summary: { "chunk": <I>, "created": K, "failed": 0|N, "duration_seconds": <int> }

Rules:
  - Do NOT modify the ATP or ATR — only link new tests to them.
  - Do NOT exceed 10 sustained writes/sec inside the subagent (xray-cli already throttles, but be aware).
  - On 429 or 5xx: retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times, then mark the TC as failed and continue with the rest of the chunk.
  - On 4xx (excluding 429): stop the chunk and report partial state.
  - Critical Rule #8 (File Operations): never overwrite an existing TC silently — if the summary already exists, report and skip.
```

##### Modality jira-native (no Xray plugin; subagent loads `/acli`)

Briefing (6 components per `agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`):

```
Goal: Create <K> Jira Test issues in project <PROJECT_KEY> for chunk <I>/<TOTAL>, link each to the parent Story <STORY_KEY> via "is tested by", and return their issue keys.

Context docs:
  - <PBI_FOLDER>/test-specs/<spec>.md (TC definitions for this chunk)
  - .agents/jira-fields.json (custom field IDs auto-discovered by `bun run jira:sync-fields`)
  - .agents/jira-required.yaml (custom-field manifest)
  - .claude/skills/test-documentation/references/jira-setup.md §3 (Modality jira-native field layout)
  - .claude/skills/test-documentation/references/jira-test-management.md §7 (Description template)

Skills to load: /acli

Exact instructions:
  1. For each TC in the chunk:
     a. [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Create Issue: project=<PROJECT_KEY>, issueType=Test, summary="{per TC naming convention}", priority={Critical|High|Medium|Low}, labels=[regression, ...], epic=<REGRESSION_EPIC_KEY>.
     b. Capture the returned issue key as <TEST_KEY>.
     c. [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue: issue=<TEST_KEY>, description={full Description template per jira-test-management.md §7}, fields={ {{jira.test_status}}: Draft, {{jira.to_be_automated}}: <bool> }.
     d. [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Link Issues: linkType={{jira.link_types.test.name}}, outward=<TEST_KEY>, inward=<STORY_KEY>.   # Story is tested by Test
  2. Do NOT recreate ATP/ATR custom fields on the Story — those were already populated by the orchestrator before dispatch.

Report format:
  JSON array per TC:
  [
    {
      "tc_local_id": "<spec id>",
      "issue_key": "<PROJ>-<N>",
      "linked_to_story": true,

  - Custom-field IDs come from .agents/jira-fields.json — do NOT hardcode `customfield_*` numbers.
  - On 429 or 5xx: retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times.
  - On 4xx (excluding 429): stop the chunk and report partial state.
  - Critical Rule #8 (File Operations): never overwrite an existing TC silently — if the summary already exists, report and skip.
  - Critical Rule #1 (Login Credentials): ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN comes from .env, never hardcode.
```

##### Aggregation in the main thread

After all parallel subagents return, the orchestrator:

1. Concatenates the JSON arrays into a single creation report.
2. Sums totals (created / failed) and computes per-chunk duration.
3. Feeds the issue-key list into the Traceability linking step (this section §4 + §5 step "for each TC").
4. If any chunk reported `failed > 0`, surface the failed TCs to the user before proceeding to traceability linking. Do NOT auto-retry across chunks; let the user decide retry / skip / abort per the error protocol in `agentic-qa-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md`.

##### Fallback to serial (N <= 10)

For N <= 10 TCs, classify inline — the dispatch overhead is not justified. The serial flows below (Modality jira-xray and Modality jira-native) remain canonical. They also describe the procedure each parallel subagent runs internally for its assigned chunk.

### Update

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/xray-cli` skill (Modality jira-xray). In Modality jira-native, load `/acli` — these update calls become `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue` on the Story or Test customfields.

```
[TMS_TOOL] Update ATP:
  id: {from ATP ID}
  results: {from ATR name}
  analysis: {from test analysis content}
  complete: true

[TMS_TOOL] Update ATR:
  id: {from ATR ID}
  report: {from test report content}
  complete: true

[TMS_TOOL] Update TC:
  id: {from TC ID}
  status: PASSED
  workflow-status: Candidate
  precondition: {from test environment details}
  spec: {from step-by-step specification}
```

### Verify traceability

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/xray-cli` skill (Modality jira-xray). In Modality jira-native, load `/acli` and walk the links manually via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Search Issues`.

```
[TMS_TOOL] Verify Traceability:
  issue: {from ticket ID}
```

Expected output: all links verified (US <-> ATP <-> ATR <-> TCs). If any link is missing, apply the fixes in §10.

## 10. Fixing broken traceability

Common failure modes and their fixes:

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| TC not linked to Story | Update TC with Story reference |
| TC not linked to ATP | Update TC with ATP reference |
| TC not linked to ATR | Update TC with ATR reference |
| ATP not linked to ATR | Update ATP with ATR reference |
| ATP not linked to Story | Update ATP with Story reference |
| TC name doesn't follow convention | Rename TC to `{US_ID}: TC#: Validate <CORE> <CONDITIONAL>` |
| ATP name wrong | Rename to `Test Plan: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}` |
| ATR name wrong | Rename to `Test Results: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}` |
| TC has no AC link | Identify which AC it covers and add the reference |

Procedure:

1. Run `[TMS_TOOL] Verify Traceability` — read the gap list.
2. For each issue, apply the fix above.
3. Re-run `[TMS_TOOL] Verify Traceability` to confirm all links are resolved.
4. Log what was fixed in a comment on the User Story for audit trail.

## 11. Reference implementation — Jira + Xray

The canonical implementation this file was derived from uses Jira with Xray. Mapping:

| Generic concept | Jira/Xray implementation |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Test Case ID | Jira issue key (e.g., `PROJ-123`) |
| Test Case issue type | Xray Test |
| Test Plan | Xray Test Plan (or Jira Story + custom field) |
| Test Execution (ATR) | Xray Test Execution |
| Regression Epic | Jira Epic with label `test-repository` |
| Results import | Xray REST API (JUnit / Cucumber formats) |
| CLI | `bun xray` (load `/xray-cli` skill) |

Other TMS tools (Coda, Azure DevOps, TestRail) implement the same four-entity model with different issue types. The naming conventions, linking order, and traceability rules above apply unchanged.
